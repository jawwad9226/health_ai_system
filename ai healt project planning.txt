I understand you want to create a more advanced AI/ML-based health prediction system. Let's design a comprehensive solution. I'll help you think through this step by step.

1. Data Sources Integration:
- Electronic Health Records (EHRs)
- Medical imaging (X-rays, MRIs, CT scans)
- Lab test results
- Genetic data
- Wearable device data (heart rate, sleep patterns, activity levels)
- Patient symptoms and history
- Environmental and lifestyle factors

2. Enhanced AI/ML Features:
- Deep Learning models for image analysis (detecting tumors, fractures, etc.)
- Natural Language Processing for:
  - Medical report analysis
  - Patient symptom description understanding
  - Medical literature integration
- Predictive Analytics for:
  - Disease risk assessment
  - Patient readmission prediction
  - Treatment response prediction
  - Drug interaction analysis

Would you like me to create a technical architecture diagram for this enhanced system? We can also discuss specific components you're most interested in implementing first.

Also, what specific health conditions or medical scenarios would you like this system to focus on? This will help us determine the most appropriate AI/ML models and data requirements.
